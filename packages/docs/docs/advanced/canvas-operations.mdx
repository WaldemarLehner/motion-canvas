# Canvas Operations

Because Motion Canvas is build ontop of the Browser's 2D Rendering Context, we
can make use several canvas operations that are provided by the Browser.

## Filters

<AnimationPlayer name="canvas-operations-filters" />

Every Component accepts a list of filters. You can find a list of all filters
the Browser can understand on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter).

All filters available in Motion Canvas can be found under
`@motion-canvas/2d/lib/partials`
([API Documentation](/api/2d/partials#Functions)). Note that some filters, like
`opacity`, can be set directly on the [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node#opacity),
and as a result are not exported from [partials](/api/2d/partials#Functions).

`filters` accepts an array. This means that you can stack multiple filters onto
a single Node. The order in which you add them does matter, as can be seen
below:

<AnimationPlayer name="canvas-operations-filters-stacking" />

You can see that for example the green trail turns yellow on the right side
while remaining green on the left.

## Masking and Composite Operations

Composite Operations define how two layers are stacked ontop of each other. This
way it is possible to define Masks. MDN has a
[great visualisation of all Composite Operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation#operations).

If you are familiar with Adobe After Effects, you might know about
[Track Mattes](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/track-mattes-and-traveling-mattes.html).
Track Mattes allow you to define a Background "Color" Layer, and a Foreground
"Stencil" Layer. The Alpha Matte Layer for example will multiply the
background's color by the stencil's alpha value.

The same effect can be achieved in Motion Canvas with the help of Composite
Operations using `source-in` and `source-out`.

Create a new cached [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) that contains 2 children,
the "stencil", and the "value" layers.

```tsx
const yOffset = createSignal(0);
yield scene.add(<Background/>);
yield scene.add(
  <Node cache>
    {/** This is your "stencil". It determines if something is visible or not */}
    <AnimatedMotionCanvasIcon ... />
    {/** This is your "value". It determines the output color if the stencil doesn't block it */}
    <Img y={yOffset} src={exampleImage}
      {/* 'source-in' for alpha stencil, 'source-out' for inverted alpha stencil*/}
      compositeOperation={'source-in'}
    />
  </Node>
);

yield* yOffset(100, 2);
yield* yOffset(-100, 2);
```

<AnimationPlayer name="canvas-operations-alpha-matte" />
An example of how composite operations are used to create a mask. The Motion Canvas
Icon acts as the stencil, the image in the back as the value.

## Cached Nodes

Both Filters and Composite Operations require a cached
[`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node). Filters can set it automatically, while
Composite Operations require you to set it explicitly on the parent
[`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node).

A cached [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) and its children are rendered on an
offscreen canvas first, before getting added to the main scene.  
For filters this is needed because they are applied to the entire canvas. By
creating a new canvas and moving the elements that should get affected by the
filters over, applying filters to the entire "new" canvas, and then moving back
the result, you effectively only apply the filters to the moved elements.

:::caution Performance Implications 
If you care about playback performance, for
example because you want to embed the Scene on a website, try to minimize the
use of cached Nodes as each cached [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) means a separate offscreen canvas.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
:::

To turn a [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node) into a cached Node, simply pass the
[`cache`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps/#cache) property

```tsx
<Node cache>...</Node>
<Node cache={true}>...</Node>
```

Note that all Components inherit from [`Node`](/api/2d/components/Node), so you
can set the property on them directly.
